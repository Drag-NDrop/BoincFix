Our main objective is to track if the system is currently being interactively used or not.

So, to keep on the straight and narrow, all checks asks if the system is ACTIVE.
All booleans coming from checks, will have a true value, that indicates that the system is currently considered ACTIVE.
And a false value, indicating that the system is currently considered IDLE.

So,
Active = true
Idle = false
