Our main objective is to track if the system is currently being interactively used or not.

So, to keep on the straight and narrow, all checks asks if the system is in ACTIVE state. I.e. In use by a logged in user.
All booleans coming from checks, will, if they have a TRUE value, indicate that the system is currently considered ACTIVE.
And if they have a FALSE value, indicating that the system is currently considered IDLE.

So,
ACTIVE = true
IDLE = false
